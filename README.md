 #Breast Cancer Classification
Breast Cancer Classification is a supervised machine learning project designed to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant using medical diagnostic features. The project implements a complete machine learning pipeline including data cleaning, feature selection, model training, and model evaluation using Python, with all code and data contained in a simple repository structure.

### Main Function Points
- Binary classification of breast cancer tumors (benign vs. malignant)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing workflow
- Feature selection and engineering
- Machine learning model training
- Model evaluation and performance metrics
- Supervised learning approach using labeled medical diagnostic data

### Technology Stack
- Python (100% of codebase)
- Machine learning libraries (likely scikit-learn, pandas, numpy based on project scope)
- Data processing and analysis tools
